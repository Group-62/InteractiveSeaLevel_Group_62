We intend to create a fun and well-functioning visualization of the globe that will allow the users to play around and see the change in sea level and its effect on coastlines during the past years. This could be the starting point of a more complex program that would allow predictions of future changes and would consider other information such as weather and melting poles. The program will run in a web page that should be simple and well looking. It should allow the user to travel around the globe in an easy and intuitive way, as well as travel through the time state of the sea level, running smoothly and with little lag. In other words, we want to design a webpage that will allow observation of the sea level change along the years, all this delivering a great user experience.
This software could bring great benefits for projects that worry about the rise or decrease of the sea level such as new edifications or the conservation of existing ones. It would also help the acknowledgement towards how we human beings are affecting the planet and possibly offer some of the key factors that should be reduced or considered to slow down sea level effects.
