# InteractiveSeaLevel_Group_62
## Description
This website displays sea level data in a visually appealing and interactive way using Python.
The application allows users to enter a location and date, and the 3D world visualization will move to that location, and display the sea level changes for the given date. The application uses an ETOPO database and multiple sea level databases to provide accurate visualizations.

## Using the Application
When you access the website, you will be presented with a form that allows you to enter a location and select a time range. After submitting the form, the website will show the sea level data for the selected location and time range on the 3D visualitation.

You can interact with the graph by hovering over data points to see more information, zooming in and out, and panning to different areas of the graph.

## Additional Features
In addition to visualizing sea level changes, this web application also includes the following features:

Interactive Controls: Use the arrow keys or the on-screen controls to move around the world and zoom in on specific places.
Multiple Sea Level Databases: The application uses multiple sea level databases to provide more accurate and comprehensive visualizations.
Data Sources: The ETOPO database provides the topography data, while the sea level databases provide the sea level rise data.
Adjustable Sea Level Rise: The application allows users to adjust the sea level rise value to see how it affects sea levels at different locations.
